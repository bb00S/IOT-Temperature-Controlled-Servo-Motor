# IOT-Temperature-Controlled-Servo-Motor
# Intro
This GitHub repo contains all code required and produced by me and my mentor for the "Temperature-Controlled-Servo-Motor"; made as part of final project for the subject called Internet of Things in the 2022-23 academic year. 

The project includes a report on the development of a system for an independent automatic fan regulator that is controlled by an electric servo motor in accordance with our requirements. The plan envisages that the system supports different modes of operation, and in accordance with that, it is possible to manage the sensors with assistance of the implemented software solution. Built-in technologies strive to make the system more efficient and reliable in coordination with closed-loop feedback control. With the aim of achieving credibility of the control over the speed intensity of the fan itself, we integrated a DHT11 temperature sensor on the Arduino UNO board. In this case, the microcontroller has the task of controlling the speed of the electric fan in accordance with the requirements.

In addition, we have integrated an LCD screen in order to simplify interpretation of data.The room temperature will be expressed according to the Celsius scale. To approach a real automation application the variables that were studied and controlled are temperature and humidity. In automatic mode, the measurement of control variables is carried out, while the regulation will be held according to the conditions to which it is exposed.
